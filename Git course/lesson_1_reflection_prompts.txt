How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    A lot easier, since the parts with changes is showed next to eachother.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can find error and mistakes faster.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With manually saving you can do more logical savings, automatic saving is good
    if you often forget to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Often in coding when changing something, you need to change in several files,
    e.g. changing html and css files making up a webpage.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Keep track on changes and also fast find differences in code in different
    commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know that I can get back to the older version, which give more opportunity
    to try new things.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
